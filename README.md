Basic Description:

Its a good practice to have a continous integration and continous deployment setup in any organization.
It helps us to focus on feature specific development. 
The building, testing and deploying app to the playstore can be done by integration services like AppCenter(https://appcenter.ms/)

In this project i have created a master branch with branch level permission. All your final working code will be present in this branch. 
And a test branch which will send an android .apk file to the testers after executing a test on the appcenter.
Finally, there is a dev branch which will have the latest working feature code.

Also, some feature branchs which contains some basic features.
